## About me

I'm Lukáš Šembera and I work on enterprise security products at HPE in Prague. In 2009, I finished bachelor degree in computer science at Faculty of science, Palacky University, Olomouc and then in 2012, I also gained master degree at Faculty of informatics, Masaryk University, Brno.

My main area of expertise is the Scala programming language and related technologies like Akka, Spray, Slick and others. I've also been working with technologies from the enterprise Java land, especially with the Spring framework and JPA. Furthermore, I'm interested in functional programming, distributed systems, databases and software development in general. Except computer-related things I enjoy travelling, studying and playing chess (well, mostly online), video games and occasionally also football and tennis.
